# Skytower Arduino Code
Includes (or will include) code for the three Arduinos in the Skytower system.

The first Arduino decodes PPM signals from an RC transmitter, then sends it
through an XBee network.

## Pre-requisites:
* PPM Library:
Uses https://github.com/Nikkilae/PPM-reader,
must be extracted into the Arduino library folder
* XBee Library: https://github.com/Nikkilae/PPM-reader,
available in the Arduino library manager
